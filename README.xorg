Sentry
======


This folder holds the whole setup for our `Sentry`_.

Layout
------

Since modern development hipsters don't bother providing proper packages for Debian, we'll have to handle it by hand:
- A virtualenv is setup in ``/home/web/sentry/venv/``
- It contains all dependencies
- The X.org setup lives in ``xorg_sentry/``
